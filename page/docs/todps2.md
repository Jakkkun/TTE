## Base Mechanics

Here will be display a simple description of base mechanics of the game. These are already explained during gameplay, but may have some effects that were only found out during experimentation.

### Stats

Each character 8 stats seperated into two different categories:

Main Stats:

- Physical Attack(_Phy.Atk_) --> Physical Damage increase, does not increase solid stance break chance, or crit chance, or anything else.
- Physical Defense(_Phy.Def_) --> Physical Damage inflicted decrease
- Magic Attack(_Mag.Atk_) --> Magic Damage dealt increase
- Magic Defense(_Mag.Def_) --> Magic Damage inflicted decrease

Sub Stats:

- Strength(_Str_) - Determines Character HP. [HP = Strength Stat X 6]
- Evade(_Eva_) - Decreases Enemy's Critical Rate and increases chances of activating Evasion.
- Concentration(_Con_) - Increase Critical Rate. Keep in mind that criticals have a cooldown before they can be done again.
- Accuracy(_Acc_) - Decreases enemy blast gain rate and breaks through enemies Evasion.

Definitions:

**Evasion**: Chance to activate solid stance and auto-guard attacks, has to be massive to be able to auto-guard and solid stance through bosses attacks. (140k for KOSMO)

**Solid Stance**: Attack does no stagger (but still does damage). A small white/gray puff of air will appear where the attack hits. Enemy may drop all solid stance after or before certain attacks (such as recovery animation on KOSMO), and the player drops all during attacks.

**Auto-guard**: The character/enemy will automatically enter guard animation when hit by an attack. This decreases damage more than a solid stance.

The difference between these two categories is that the main stats will increase as the character Levels up while the Sub Stats does not. The Sub Stats values are determined by the Main Stats itself.

Strength - Phy.Attack and Phy.Defense

Evade - Phy.Defense and Mag.Attack

Concentration - Mag.Attack and Mag.Defense

Accuracy - Mag.Defense and Phy.Attack

All stats can be increased by other means such as Accessories or Herbs.

Survival mode increases your intrinsic defence value by a ton. This means guarding would make some attacks hit 0s.

### CC

This game works with a chain capacity (_CC_) system. You begin each fight with your minimum CC value and, by doing actions, you increase your current maximum CC by 1. This happens until your character's maximum CC value; if you do any actions after that, your current maximum CC goes down to the current value or your minimum CC (the highest one).

### Blast Mechanics

When attacking, blocking and taking damage, you will gain blast points. This blast can have different uses depending on the situation. With 1, 2 or 3 full bars of blast, you can do your Blast Caliber (BC) during a chain. With at least 1 full bar, you can do a Damage Break. When the enemies have full blast (by getting hit), they also do a damage break automatically. Also, when you complete a bar, you can a quite a few i-frames.

Definitions:

**Damage Break**: If your character is being continuously staggered by the enemy (more than one hit) and you have 1 complete Blast gauge, press L1 (just before or during a hit) to activate Damage Break. Damage Break takes 50 Blast Points and activates the blast break effect (same as enemies) for 1 second. There seem to be a cooldown between player's damage breaks. Most enemies can only do a damage break when on the ground, while the player and some specific enemies can also do it in the air.

**I-Frames**: Invincibility Frames, you take no damage and do not stagger. You can also gain blast during this, if the source of the I-Frames wasn't a bar gain.

### Spells and Artes

Artes and spells cost more CC than a normal attack, but they normally do more damage and have special effects. Some artes and spells can OTG and Freeze enemies. They also can cause various status effects to the user and enemies. Spells usually have a higher stagger and damage, but they need casting time before coming out. There is also a limit to 4 "big" spells on screen.

Definitions:

**OTG**: When used against an enemy in any knockdown state (light to hard knockdown), they will get back up to normal stagger.

**Freeze**: Also called position lock; some attacks freeze depending on stagger time. It is easier to see after a stun, since the stagger goes to 80+. This freeze makes the enemy not move (and stagger in-place) for the duration of the stagger. Easier to see from a Phantom Edge in the air after a crit. It also happens, though in a smaller scale, during various artes.

You can use skills and equipment to reduce casting time. DeEarth also reduces cast time of Dark Spells, same for Philia's earth necklace. You can also reduce it by doing artes or other spells.

As you constantly use artes in combos, the Casting Time for all spells will reduce as far as 80%, enabling spells to cast faster. This has a limit to 31 frames (check). Below is the list of methods on how this feature works.

- Normals will not reduce Incantation Time.
- Every arte used in combos will reduce Casting Time by 10%.
- Every spell used in combos will reduce Casting Time by 20%.
- If you cast the same spell more than one time, that second and any subsequent spells will not have any reduction on the Casting Time, however, the actual reduction will still persist when casting another spell.

Ex: Grave (100%) -> Grave(100%) -> Grave(100%) -> Stone Wall (40%)

### Extra Information

**Air Recovery**: If the enemy knocks you up into the air, press square just as you touch the ground. Requires your fall duration to be a certain time (needs to be atleast the last fall stagger animation of Leon). Thus, only works for attacks high up in the air. Attacks with hard knockdown also are unable to be recovered (your character will lay down again before getting up).

**Charge**: Press Square + Down to Charge. When Charging, the character will decrease enemy Spell Damage by 75% (also not stagger to spells), increases Accuracy and the next attack will break the enemy's guard. Consumes 2 CC Points per use.

**Penetrate**: All hits are defended by a solid stance until the penetrate is broken by doing an x number of attacks. Even during attacks and recovery frames. Bosses have this and Leon (with Demon Lance Zero) too.

**Back-row Protection**: If an enemy is running and tries to pass through you, if you block before he passes you can bounce him back, negating all Solid Stance in the process. Some enemies try to do this to hit you. (Such as the stars in arcana ruins, and most golems.)

**Nakiriri Dolls**: Nakiriri Dolls change the character it is equipped on to another character. This lets you use characters that are not available yet in the story or are not in your current party. You can also use it to apply the effect of equipments and attacks of certain characters to another.
When equipping narikiri dolls, some attacks change properties to reflect the wearer's attack properties despite what is shown in the attack description. The following is a full list of such attacks:

- Stahn: All regular attacks, Rekuuzan, Kogahazan, Souryuu Rengazan, Senkuuretsuha
- Rutee: All regular attacks, Snipe Air, Snipe Roar, Bloody Rose
- Philia: Regular attacks that use her sword (her bomb attack Up + Circle remains blunt)
- Woodrow: Regular attacks that use his sword (his bow attacks remain piercing), Kourinshou, Bassaiga, Setsuna
- Leon: All regular attacks, Souryuu Rengazan, Sougazan
- Mary: All regular attacks, Moushuuken, Shunjinrouga, Senhoushou, Houtsuishou, Shishiou Messai, Kappa Bakusougeki
- Chelsea: None
- Johnny: All regular attacks
- Kongman: All regular attacks, Falcon Fledge, Great Upper, Rhomb Shoulder, Ikasu Hip, Hell's Hurricane, Ressurect Kiai, Messa Throw, Heart Break
- Lilith: All regular attacks, Turn Over, Lilith Rush, Flash Back

E.g., Johnny equipping Narikiri Stahn will change his regular attacks, Kogahazan, Rekuuzan, Souryuu Rengazan and Senkuuretsuha to sonic attacks. Mary equipping Nariki Stahn would change all those attacks into slash and blunt property attacks and so on.

**Advance Gate Points** [TODO]: You can use these on the New Game + shop to buy special effects. Float Gravity, for example, increases the launch powers of all attacks by a multiplier. You can also manipulate your end game save file to gain more points. I've tested that decreasing then increasing the difficulty in the same playthrough (so fight the final boss, save, load, fight again), has no effect on the points. Difficulty has an effect, but looks like only has an effect based on the last playthrough difficulty. So the question is:

1. Can one clear on hard (2 points), load and clear on simple, keep the 2 points (probably not)? If yes, does the simple difficulty affect the next playthrough or the hard (so clear on hard (2 points),save,load,clear on simple, save, newgame+, clear on hard(4 points))?
2. Can one manipulate difficulties to max points? Something like Hard (0p+2p) -> Simple (2p+1p) -> Hard(3p+2p) -> Chaos(5p+2p?) I did 7 newgame+ plays and this would be 4. Possible? [TODO]

**Critical Attacks**: Criticals can stun enemies or apply status effects depending on the character. Crits all go to 80 stagger, the next hit after the crit adds more stagger. When the enemy is stunned (usually because of a crit), all attacks OTG.

**Text Skip**: Hold X and Square to skip all current text. Works better than mashing.

**Collector's Book Bonus**: Maxxed Collectors book gives you 15 of every item after beating the final boss. (test on Leon's side?) [TODO]

**Dash Lock**: After doing a ground dash on a chain (outside of chains you can link ground dashes after any action other than spells/ground dash) you can only dash again after a back step or after touching the ground without doing any moves. That is why "wavedashing" (jumping then dashing to the ground) is better for neutral game.

**Dash Direction**: To dash to an enemy, always do the input to the direction your character is facing. Including when you mix-up an enemy during a jump or chain.

**Random Launch Power**: After 100 hits, launch power becomes slightly random (+/- a variable) to make infinite combos harder.

**Air limitations**: After a certain height, no action other than jumps and aiming dashes are allowed. This is due to the player character being too close to the physical ceiling of the map.

## Glitches

In this section, we have a group of glitches and a small description on how to replicate/explain them. In this section, you will not find glitches that are currently useful for Combat, this is found on Chapter 3.

### Out of Bounds and Sequence Breaks

#### Skip Cave Queen

By walking on the side of a ledge on the screen that the Cave Queen boss battle starts, you can skip it and get to Moreau town faster. You can buy some items there and talk to NPCs, but you still need to beat Cave Queen to continue the story. (reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzvcOjRu81o)

#### Back to Oberon

You can take a boat back to Oberon Factory after it is destroyed. Some camera angles glitch out (you can go to the screen that the Leon fight happens).

### Exploits

#### Infinite Gald and EX points

(reference video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAJMLSBYs1A) Go into a shop and buy something (x1). After that, add one of one item (dpad-right) then click buy on another item (circle). Cancel (X) then you will see an underflow, after this, you can do R-STICK left to "buy" the minimum possible, thus, gaining infinite gald and ex points. Using this when selling will cause you to lose all your money (and the items) instead.

#### Infinite Swordian Points

"Cave Queen" (Stan), "Cave Head" (Lion), "Caves Well" (Philia) monsters in the Definite Strike arena award Swordian Points when defeated on Hard or higher (TODO test). Can easily be exploited for max Swordian Points.

### Minor Combat Glitches

#### Micro-Dash

If you do the input of a back-dash or aiming-dash but cast an arte at the same time, you will get a small momentum forward. Backstep has the most distance, but it is still very small. Currently has no use. Also works with spells. The same happens when landing from the air (depending on your momentum).

#### Fake Normal Attack

When using a non air-enabled arte in the air, a normal attack comes out. Currently has no extra effects. The only strange thing is that you can attack cancel (Section 3) this attack, causing you to spend 2 CC for 1 normal attack.

#### Definite Strike Lock [TODO]

If you're during a definite strike chain and stun/sleep/stone an enemy that floats/flies without making it drop to the ground, the enemy will not be able to recover from the hit and will stay floating in the air.

#### Stagger Overload

Enemies can only take so much stagger before going instantly into hard knockdown state. It happens when stagger is past 40 and you do any attack, arte or action that adds more stagger.

## Combat Techniques

Here we will discuss various different techniques/glitches that can be used during combat.

### General Techniques

#### Spell Locking

If you quickly cancel a long spell 4 times, all spells will lock (they will not stop casting). This is because of two factors:

1. The max number of big spells in the field is 4.
2. The casting time when you cancel a spell still ticks down in memory.
   It is not possible to abuse 2. currently. However, since you can stack 4 spells without them coming out a flag is activated that stop any more spells. Since no spells are ending (and thus clearing the flag), no more spells come out for the rest of the fight!

#### Stop Flow Glitch (Vanilla only)

Cast Stop Flow 128 times to use spells with no casting time. Each Stop Flow increments the total casting time for spells by a little bit, until an overflow happens (@128). You can also only cast Stop Flow then cancel it to have the same effect (no need to fully cast the spell).

#### Moving Hit-Boxes

Dashing a few frames after an attack can move its hit box. It depends heavily on the attack to work (for example, Phantom Edge works). Needs to be done 1-6 frames after the attack.

#### Spell Block

Casting an spell just as an enemy hits you negates the damage (gives you i-frames), you can also enter the hitbox with the magic cancel animation! Only works for attacks that lose the hitbox once it hit something though (multi hits attacks are out of the question). It can trigger a blast gain, and that generates more i-frames. The spell release animation has even more i-frames, and can be used easily by holding the spell down.

#### Arena Edges

Jumping at it with slow to medium speed will cause you to lose speed and go up as normal but jumping at with medium-fast to fast speed causes you to bounce of the wall (in the direction of the control stick), this allows you to have an "triple" jump on edges, maintain some of the speed of the jump and more combo shenanigans.

#### Air Walking

Based on Arena Edges, the ceiling has an interesting effect. When in the air, reach the ceiling (possible with just normals and jumps) to have infinite jumps. Release guard button(if you have it pressed) then you can change direction midair, pretty fast. Fall speed is increased when you bonk your head in the ceiling, since your y-velocity is reset to 0 each time.

#### Slow Falling

After an arte/jump that puts you in the air, hold up/do an attack just as the momentum is changing from upwards(momentum higher than 0) to downards(momentum lower than zero) (you want momentum=0), you will then fall in slow motion, works bests after some artes.

#### Spell Cancel Landing/Recovery [TODO]

Fastest landing cancel is 25 frames, and cc recovery is 1 every 4 frames. Normal (Straight fall) landing is 42 frames. With horizontal momentum it barely saves time. You can also use it to recover faster from a spell recovery-frames (so, after realeasing a spell, cast another and imediatelly cancel) (Needs checking).

#### Bait Reset

When an opponent is walking or running, just before he does an attack, stagger him (need to check frame data) [TODO]. When you drop the combo (on purpose) he will do his (stored) attack immediately and you can punish him while he is attacking, continuing the combo.

#### Bounce

Some techs makes the enemy bounce on the ground and others do not. For example, most artes that have the hard knockdown effect cause the enemy to not bounce in the ground. Ending those combos with a normal instead will make so that the enemy will bounce once it touches the ground. Normals always bounce, unless you're using a special belt from Kongman (if you're using a Nakiriri doll with Kongman, the effect works on other characters too). Keep in mind that this effect is only for normals done in the ground (air normals do not carry the knockdown effect).

#### Push

So, when an enemy attack requires melee distance to perform, you can aiming dash just as the attack is about to come out (just when the enemy finishes walking, but before the attack comes out) to push the enemy away. You can walk forward to make the enemy end their walk animation while you're closer to them, which makes the push have a bit more knockback.

#### Fast CC Recovery

By rapidly casting and cancelling base spells (like fireball), you can quickly increase your minimum CC all the way to your maximum CC.

#### CC Recovery Glitch (Vanilla only)

After doing any action, mash block. This must be done just as the Chain ends or the recovery time of your action ends. This will cause your CC to rise much more than it was supposed to, possibly even to max. Only works on Manual Mode. (reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlQw_DRxGj0)

#### Air Recovery Glitch [LEONONLY] [TODO]

Somehow, air recovery glitched diagonal up arte; upon air recovery, continue it with backdash, aiming dash or jiaanshii and then do the arte, not sure if you have to do the reversed aiming dash position for it to work(on videos, the one with the mummies).

#### Swallow Tallon Glitch [LEONONLY]

Diagonal up arte has another interesting effect, mid-way cancelling it with an jump usually makes you go up and a little bit forward but if you manage to do a jump, isntead of going a little bit back you will go a lot and fast; really hard trick. If you do an attack instead, you get a small momentum upward.

### Gliding

First normal attack of a chain has so much hidden proprieties: first off, it carries momentum. So it enables Gliding and other combos. However, if you used it already, it gets floaty.

So, how does one use this bahavior to do Glides? You can simply do an aiming dash in the air (after a jump, double jump, arte or jumps into arte) into a normal attack (all artes not tested) to maintain the momentum of the aiming dash. Theres one exception: If an enemy is higher than you you can always Glide, but you can only Glide from above one time (and as said before, you lose this above Glide if you use an normal attack). The velocity and angle depend on the distance (and angle) you have with your enemy. To do this straight from the ground, the fastest way you can get an air aiming dash is to use your left stick and do an Up-Away to Forward motion, passing through the neutral of the stick.

### Attack/Neutral Cancel [TODO]

Attack Cancel (A.C.): By pressing artes + attack button on the same frame you can get interesting effects. Blast penalty doesn't happen since the games thinks you're also doing a normal attack. Doing it twice can start an Neutral Cancel, which can glitch some artes. You can also start a Neutral Cancel by doing a normal attack followed by an Attack Cancel. You will lose the Neutral Cancel effect after doing an arte, attack, A.C. arte or ending the chain. (List [TODO]; theres also a .txt with just this info.) (sometimes doesn't work?)

#### Follow-up Negation (new name needed)

A.C can be used to ignore follow-up artes or other mechanics that require 2 moves to be used in sucession. For example, Leon can use Demon Fang twice in a row if the second one is A.C.'ed.

#### Magic Landing Dash

When landing, if you do a Attack Cancelled Spell, you will get a small momentum forward (like the normal would do). This is similar to a Micro-Dash.

#### Attack Cancel Spell

When casting an Attack Cancelled Spell, there will be no restriction on casting time when doing the same spell. This cost +1 CC. Thus you can do A.C Grave (100%) -> A.C Grave(80%) -> A.C Grave(60%)

#### Phantom Edge Glich [LEONONLY]

Neutral Cancel an Phantom Edge for it to be short instead of long (distance); only happens for the ground version.

### Stagger Techniques

#### Stagger Storage

By doing an arte and dropping the combo you get an additional 20 frames of stagger stored on your aiming dash. Then, if you do a normal attack or arte into an aiming dash, said attack/arte will get an additional 20 frames of stagger. Doing an aiming dash/backstep/charge/touchdown from jumping before using the stored stagger negates the effect. Stagger Storage only works in the same chain, so no Demon Fang -> Wait -> Aiming Dash. Use jumps and other artes to use it without knocking the enemy down (taking out some stagger equip also helps).

#### Combo Assist

Like other games, doing an attack while the enemy is still staggered (in Destiny DC you need atleast to do atleast 1 frame after the previous attack hits, so sometimes you may need to delay your attacks) increses the stagger by a little bit to help chain things better. The values are:

- Normal Attacks : +12 frames of stagger.
- Most Artes: +14 frames of stagger.
- Leon's Glimmer Dragon (Garyuusen): +22 frames of stagger.
- Weakness attacks: They add 2 stagger. Resisted attacks lose 2 stagger.
- Stagger Equipment: Chelsea best equips add 15 frames of stagger to normal attacks and artes. Philia best equips add 18 frames of stagger to magic and air spells.

The window that you can increase the stagger of the previous attack is about 25 frames.

#### Arte Stagger Change [TODO]

Doing an attack before the projectile of a previous arte still has not reached the enemy can decreses a bit of stagger, or even changes it.

### Semi-auto Techniques [TODO]

(does it effect casting time?) (AUTO does not seem to work... seems to be a different mechanic -- the so called reserve arte/item. Test that out mid-combo?)

(These require semi-auto to be active)

Semi-auto on Destiny shows most effect in grounded combat, since air actions do not initiate any unique mechanics. When grounded, doing an arte/normal (suficiantly away from the enemy, depending on the arte/normal) will start a forced neutral animation followed by a semi-auto run animation. This forced neutral animation lasts the longer when running away from the enemy (~15 frames) and can be extended by using an aiming dash or charge. The arte used to cause the neutral animation is called the _SB buffered action_ (see below for more information). If you use an a non-shortcut arte during the animation, that arte will become the buffered action instead.
The SB buffered action persists between ground dashes but dissapears whenever the forced neutral animation is cancelled or if another attack/arte is pressed (no need for the attack to come out, just the buttom press causes it) before its execution. Jumping causes the SB buffered action to be performed, if it is air-enabled.
Most of the following techniques require the player character to be in the forced neutral animation to function. You cannot be in any chain for the semi-auto run to start.

#### Spell auto re-cast

If you use a spell without the neutral animation and try to cancel it, it will automatically be re-casted. This only works for non-shortcut set spells (this is because the same spell is both the buffered and the expected action -- constantly.) They will not start a forced neutral animation. This can be abused to instantly lock large-scale artes.

#### Short-hop neutrals

By initiating a forced neutral animation with a neutral attack, you can backstep during the animation to automatically do the buffered neutral when on the air (due to the backstep animation). This can also be done after short-cut artes, since they do not overwrite the SB buffered action.

#### Spatial-buffer cancelling (SB Cancelling)

Doing any arte or spell during the forced neutral animation will make so that it come out on the spot, without the semi-auto run. If, during the arte, the distance between player/enemy decreases so that the SB buffered action would be executed normally (i.e. after the semi-auto run), the current arte execution will be stopped and the buffered action will start (thus cancelling the previous arte animation).
If during the arte you used to cancel the animation your characters goes airborne, and the SB buffered actio is air-enabled, said action will occur the moment the user leaves the ground. Some artes may not enable the player to follow the action with artes (usually those that still need to created hitboxes or entities), but if the SB buffered action is a normal attack, it will always be cancelled (thus you can use the normal as a link to other action). After leaving the ground the SB buffered action is consumed wheather the arte is cancelled or not, thus no more spatial effects will occur (if you get close to the enemy after touching the ground).
Some artes may not seem to leave the ground, but even the smallest jump in height results in a normal (ex: Kong's Dragon Swarm.)

#### Attack Cancel + SB

If the arte you use during the forced neutral animation is A. C.'d or if the SB buffered action is an A. C. arte, the buffered action will be the same as a normal attack.

#### Spell SB Cancelling

SB cancelling spells (i. e. using shortcut spells with an SB action buffered) can be a good option select since it can make an arte come out before the spell has finished casting, making so that you don't get punished in situations you normally would be. It can also be used to completely negate the spell release frames, regaining control faster. Finally, if the spell ends in the air and if the SB buffered action is air-enabled, the moment your character leaves the ground the animation will be cancelled and the air action will come out. For example, Leon can use Dragon Swarm just after the jump from Demon Lance, making the lance follow Leon while Dragon Swarm is in effect.

#### SB buffer storage

By changing to Manual after causing the forced neutral animation, the SB buffered action will be saved in memory but will not be consumed. Once you return to semi-auto (even mid-chain), the SB buffered action will still be available to use. Since you can have much more accurate movements in manual, it is possible to set up a specefic position and then change to semi-auto, automatically cancelling your action due to the spatial properties of the cancel. The same rules apply once you return to semi-auto mode (normals, air actions...). This can be used to properly cancel attacks with air-enabled spells! Even the recovery of some BC's can be cancelled. This cannot be used to bypass the air limitations of the battle arena.
