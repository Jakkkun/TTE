# Tales of Vesperia Updates
:::

The Tales of Vesperia section has been updated!

Highlights include variations of the manual cancel (also called free-run cancel, FRC) and the semi-auto cancel! You can search (on the top right of the page) for "TOV FRC" and "TOV SAC" for related techniques.

The following segments require some assistance to crack down: "Taunt Cancel" and "Fake Fatal Strikes".

"Taunt Cancel" requires a more consistent setup (if possible) and ways to use Raven's personal strategy with 1 player (and without moving the camera from your current character).

"Fake Fatal Strikes" requires turbo to be used and a non-turbo consistent method is needed.
