# Tales of Destiny Updates
:::

The Tales of Destiny PS2 section has been updated!

Highlights include various stagger techniques and the spatial-buffer cancel! You can search (on the top right of the page) for "TOD stagger" and "TOD SB" for related techniques.

The page also includes information and videos about other techniques such as gliding and air-walking.

The following segments require some assistance to crack down: "Neutral Cancel" and "Advance Gate Points".

"Neutral Cancel" is a very specific technique that is hard to test due to being not that consistent and not having much effects other than changing the distance of some artes.

"Advance Gate Points" is the segment that talks about ToDPS2 New Game+. The calculations done by the game to award players points are not defined and ways to manipulate the system (if possible) are not yet documented.
