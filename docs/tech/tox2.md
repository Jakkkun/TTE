## Linked Artes

### Linked Arte Cancels (LAC)

Similar to Fatal Strikes from Vesperia, you can cancel the animation of any arte with a Linked Arte as long as the glyph is active. For example, you can use Demon Fist as Jude, then use Dragon Shot, and cancel Dragon Shot by using the Linked Arte from Demon Fist. If the character is airborne, this will cause them to fall to the ground similarly to the Quick Drop skill. 

For Linked artes that are spells (such as Rock Hexad), you can spell cancel them by guarding, just as you would a normal spell. Using this in tandem with LAC can allow you to cancel an arte at virtually any point and continue as normal. If your character has the Casting Window skill, you can also have the Linked Arte glyph come out before the intiial spell comes out.

In both cases of LAC, artes with lingering hitboxes benefit greatly from this tech. Such artes include traps (such as Mine Collapse or Sun Spark), artes that have a delayed reaction (such as Light of Ruin and Squall Shot), and spells such as Flame Ring.

## Character Specific Tech/Arte Info

### Falling Snow (Ludger)

One of the most flexible Artes on a character famous for his versatility, Falling Snow (abbreviated as FS) is a staple of Ludger's kit and can find immediate value in just about any aspect of his gameplay. To start with a short summary of FS's positives, it has:

Near instant startup
Travels about a third of the screen in about half a second
Long hitstun; long enough to AC reset from for free
Air OK
OTG

FS is a single hit, non-elemental slash arte, which makes it very valuable as a combo starter and general combo tool for its speed and distance. It also serves as a cornerstone of combo resets thanks to its OTG property and it pairing really nicely with elemental weapons.

If Ludger goes through an enemy with FS, he will turn around at the end of the arte to face them. If FS collides with an enemy from max distance, Ludger will end the arte face first in front of the enemy. He won't turn around and the recovery frames are greatly reduced.

As a mobility tool, FS is invaluable for the amount of space it covers for how fast it is, and how it can singlehandedly invalidate some artes such as Tetra Spell by speeding past all the hitboxes. FS doesn't actually have invul frames though, so be mindful of that when using it to evade artes that hit a wide range or are also just as fast, like Gnome II.

It is worth noting that despite this arte having a lot of positives, it does have one minor, but not insignificant flaw. If you swap to Hammer or Guns right after FS, your hurtbox will extend to the distance you travelled, which can leave you vulnerable if you plan to use this Arte as an evasion tool. This glitch can be sidestepped by, well, sidestepping (or any other action) between using FS and the weapon swap.

**Reverse Falling Snow (RFS)** is an extention to FS that will come out by holding FS's arte shortcut and having the arte connect. RFS has different trajectories depending on if it is used on the ground or in the air.

Ground RFS has Ludger doing a second FS in the opposite direction of the first, which ends with him back turned to the foe instead of facing them. This is particularily useful for setting up backwards hitbox-based combos, or positioning for traps. Ground FS also causes human enemies and smaller to spin, which can be problematic for aformentioned hitbox abuse, depending on what you're fighting.

Air RFS has Ludger doing his second FS in a 45 degree angle upwards, reminiscent of Air Divide from Vesperia. Air RFS comes out faster than ground RFS and also lifts the enemy slightly in place. This variant is specialized for air juggles and the lifting effect pairs up nicely with artes like Migrating Sparrows, as well as Quick Drop to keep the enemy airborne for as long as possible.

**Chromatus Falling Snow (CFS)** is effectively a different arte than the rest, as it lacks a lot of the general utility that FS normally has, due to how CS mechanics work. But it shares enough properties and is one of CS's strongest artes, so its still worth discussing. 

CFS is ground only, and will autocorrect you to face the enemy *before* the arte comes out, so it is more limited in a positioning sense. However it makes up for that by not only retaining its usual OTG property, but also comes with the rare *Iron Stance Break* property. This allows CS to break the OTG limit by bypassing the Iron Stance bosses obtain upon hitting the limit.
