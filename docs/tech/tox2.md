## Base Mechanics

Here will be displayed a simple description of the base mechanics of the game. Most of these are already explained during gameplay, but may have some effects that were only found out during experimentation.

## Glitches

In this section, we have a group of glitches and a small description on how to replicate/explain them. In this section, you will not find glitches that are currently useful for combat, this is found on the next segment.

### New Game+ Glitch

Select New Game+ From the title screen and load a clear save when prompted. After the loading is complete but before the Grade Shop pops up, press Start and Quick Save. You now have glitched your NG+.

#### "Story" Changes

The Julius fight at the start will now have your skills from the loaded game applied to it (you still won't be able to use artes, swap weapons, stagger or defeat Julius, however); for example, if Ludger had Grounded Stance active on the save you used for NG+, Julius cannot stagger him to trigger the cutscene and advance the fight. You will have to wait for him to use Overlimit and hit you with Moonlight Assault instead.

After the tutorial fight, you can change Ludger's weapons, change his skills, and even access the world map right from the start. Interestingly enough, the Spirius Gatekeeper Boss here level scales quite highly, despite being the first boss in the game and would otherwise be unfeasible to reach its level cap in a normal playthrough or NG+

Afterwards, the story cannot be progressed past the Trigleph Train, as Julius won't be there to trigger the Fractured Dimension. You can even use the world map to warp to Canaan, but you can't fight the final bosses either. The only bosses available are the Spirius Gatekeeper, the Coliseum, and the EX Dungeon.

#### "Fractured" Milla Returns

If you use the World Map to warp to a town, you'll gain access to the entire party again. Just like Ludger, they retain everything from the clear save used for this NG+. The only notable change is that Milla will use her Fractured voice lines, despite it being Prime Milla in the party. Through this, you can hear voice lines for artes Fractured Milla never had access to. Namely: The Great Spirit summons, Elemental Shot, and all three of her Mystic Artes.

## Combat Techniques

Here we will discuss various different techniques/glitches that can be used during combat.

### General Techniques

#### Weakness Reset

Just like Xillia 1, bosses in this game will counter and break out of your combos after a couple of hits, and can (for the most part) only be locked into a combo through hitting their weakness(es) and starting a power combo. In a power combo, the weakness gauge will slowly decrease until another element is added onto the combo, capping out when all 9 elements have been used in the combo. Optimized combos are ones that attempt to maximize the amount of time the weaknesss gauge is active before applying another element to extend it.

Another way to maximize the effectiveness of your power combo is to have the power hits gauge run out while the enemy is knocked down (or airborne if they are unable to air counter), and apply a weakness to start another fresh power combo from scratch. This is the basic outline of weakness resets. Be aware of the how many times you've knocked down the boss if attempting to reset via OTG (the KD limit is 3). If the KD has been reached, you can still bypass it via an arte with the Iron Stance Break property, or through Petrify/Stun from an arte that can OTG (such as backwards Hammer Flail or Muzét's Stun Blitz).

Weakness resets are a valuable tech to have in your arsenal. Outside of the obvious ability to extend your combos, it also allows you to keep your damage multiplier lower if you reset low-weakness combos early. Another utility of weakness resets is that they can bypass the forced knockdown of some Elite Monsters; by hitting few weaknesses per combo chain, they'll never hit the weakness threshold required to trigger the knockdown.

#### No Weakness Juggling

For bosses that have no air counter, it is possible to juggle them in the air without the use of power combos. This is particularly useful for some bosses that have no weaknesses such as Chronos 1 and Victor (Hammer or Guns only). To do this, you must bait out their Overlimit first by launching them and attacking them while they're airborne. Without an air counter, they will be forced to use their Overlimit instead to escape. After their Overlimit runs out, they will have no means of escape for 60 seconds until it recharges. As long as the boss is *standing* on the ground, you can juggle them freely during this time. Be aware that the boss can still recover from an aerial knockdown, but as long as they don't land, you can still keep the combo going.

#### Linked Arte Cancel (LAC)

Similar to Fatal Strikes from Vesperia, you can cancel the animation of any arte with a Linked Arte as long as the glyph is active. For example, you can use Demon Fist as Jude, then use Dragon Shot, and cancel Dragon Shot by using the Linked Arte from Demon Fist. If the character is airborne, this will cause them to fall to the ground similarly to the Quick Drop skill.

For Linked artes that are spells (such as Rock Hexad), you can spell cancel them by guarding, just as you would a normal spell. Using this in tandem with LAC can allow you to cancel an arte at virtually any point and continue as normal. If your character has the Casting Window skill, you can also have the Linked Arte glyph come out before the intiial spell comes out.

In both cases of LAC, artes with lingering hitboxes benefit greatly from this tech. Such artes include traps (such as Mine Collapse or Sun Spark), artes that have a delayed reaction (such as Light of Ruin and Squall Shot), and spells such as Flame Ring.

## Character Specific Tech/Arte Info

### Ludger

#### Falling Snow

One of the most flexible Artes on a character famous for his versatility, Falling Snow (abbreviated as FS) is a staple of Ludger's kit and can find immediate value in just about any aspect of his gameplay. To start with a short summary of FS's positives, it has:

-Near instant startup

-Travels about a third of the screen in about half a second

-Long hitstun; long enough to AC reset from for free

-Air OK

-OTG

FS is a single hit, non-elemental slash arte, which makes it very valuable as a combo starter and general combo tool for its speed and distance. It also serves as a cornerstone of combo resets thanks to its OTG property and it pairing really nicely with elemental weapons.

If Ludger goes through an enemy with FS, he will turn around at the end of the arte to face them. If FS collides with an enemy from max distance, Ludger will end the arte face first in front of the enemy. He won't turn around and the recovery frames are greatly reduced.

As a mobility tool, FS is invaluable for the amount of space it covers for how fast it is, and how it can singlehandedly invalidate some artes such as Tetra Spell by speeding past all the hitboxes. FS doesn't actually have invul frames though, so be mindful of that when using it to evade artes that hit a wide range or are also just as fast, like Gnome II.

It is worth noting that despite this arte having a lot of positives, it does have one minor, but not insignificant flaw. If you swap to Hammer or Guns right after FS, your hurtbox will extend to the distance you travelled, which can leave you vulnerable if you plan to use this Arte as an evasion tool. This glitch can be sidestepped by, well, sidestepping (or any other action) between using FS and the weapon swap.

**Reverse Falling Snow (RFS)** is an extention to FS that will come out by holding FS's arte shortcut and having the arte connect. RFS has different trajectories depending on if it is used on the ground or in the air.

Ground RFS has Ludger doing a second FS in the opposite direction of the first, which ends with him back turned to the foe instead of facing them. This is particularily useful for setting up backwards hitbox-based combos, or positioning for traps. Ground FS also causes human enemies and smaller to spin, which can be problematic for aformentioned hitbox abuse, depending on what you're fighting.

Air RFS has Ludger doing his second FS in a 45 degree angle upwards, reminiscent of Air Divide from Vesperia. Air RFS comes out faster than ground RFS and also lifts the enemy slightly in place. This variant is specialized for air juggles and the lifting effect pairs up nicely with artes like Migrating Sparrows, as well as Quick Drop to keep the enemy airborne for as long as possible.

**Chromatus Falling Snow (CFS)** is effectively a different arte than the rest, as it lacks a lot of the general utility that FS normally has, due to how CS mechanics work. But it shares enough properties and is one of CS's strongest artes, so its still worth discussing.

CFS is ground only, and will autocorrect you to face the enemy *before* the arte comes out, so it is more limited in a positioning sense. However it makes up for that by not only retaining its usual OTG property, but also comes with the rare *Iron Stance Break* property. This allows CS to break the OTG limit by bypassing the Iron Stance bosses obtain upon hitting the limit.
